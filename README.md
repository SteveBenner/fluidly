# Fluidly
A library for making your [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com/) development go more fluidly.

**Right now this is just full of future-sauce; hardly any code has been written.**

### Goals
- Programmatic loading of CSS and Javascript files as corresponding 'userstyles' and 'userscripts'.
- Improved application package management, ideally integration via something like [Homebrew Cask](http://caskroom.io/)
- Shared library and/or asset management for apps
- Plugin development support and/or tools
